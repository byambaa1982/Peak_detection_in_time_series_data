# Walk Forward Validation using NN model

## Overview
The fast and powerful methods that we rely on in machine learning, such as using train-test splits and k-fold cross-validation, do not work in the case of time-series data. This is because they ignore the temporal components inherent in the problem. 


## This Section is divided into the following parts
- [Simple NN for Time Series](#machine-learning-from-scratch)
  * [Train-Test Split]
  * [Train-Test Split]
  * [Series as Supervised Learning]
  * [Walk-Forward Validation]
  * [Data Engineering Excel data and convert it into CSV format]
  * [Run the NN model using a CSV file]
  
## Train-Test Split
The train_test_split() function will split the series taking the raw observations and the number of observations to use in the test set as arguments.
